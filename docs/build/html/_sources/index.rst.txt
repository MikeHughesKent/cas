CAS and CAS-GUI
====================================
CAS-GUI is a framework for building graphical user interfaces in Python,
specifically for applications that involve acquiring, processing and displaying 
images from cameras or camera-type systems.

It consists of CAS, a hardware abstraction layer for cameras, and the GUI
itself.

The project is hosted on `github <https://github.com/MikeHughesKent/ImageDisplayQT/>`_. Bug reports, contributions and pull requests are welcome. 
    
Exampls of simple GUIs created using CAS are `available on github <https://github.com/MikeHughesKent/cas/tree/main/examples>`_.
